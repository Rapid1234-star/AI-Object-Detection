AI Object Detection
📌 Introduction

AI Object Detection is a web-based application built with Next.js that performs real-time object detection in images or video streams using the pre-trained COCO-SSD model.

This project demonstrates how to integrate AI-powered vision models directly into a modern web app, making it accessible through a simple browser interface.

✨ Features

🚀 Built with Next.js (React) for modern web development.

🎯 Uses COCO-SSD pre-trained AI model for object detection.

📷 Supports real-time detection via webcam or uploaded images.

⚡ Optimized rendering of detection boxes & labels.

🌐 Runs entirely in the browser — no backend server required.

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Object-Detection.git
cd AI-Object-Detection


Install dependencies

npm install


Start the development server

npm run dev


Open your browser at http://localhost:3000

▶️ Usage

Upload an image or enable your webcam.

The app will automatically run the COCO-SSD model on the input.

Detected objects will be highlighted with bounding boxes and labels.

🖼️ Examples

Object Detection in Action:

Person, car, dog, etc. detected in real-time.
(Screenshots or GIFs can be added here.)

🛠️ Troubleshooting

Ensure Node.js ≥ 16 is installed.

If detection is slow, check browser GPU acceleration.

Webcam not working? → Verify browser permissions.
